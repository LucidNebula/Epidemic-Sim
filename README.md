# Epidemic-Sim
Unity simulation of an epidemic

This project was made to simulate an epidemic in a small community of approximately 2000 people.
This was worked on between a partner and I for a course, but ended up being more than just
a project for class. Rather, it became a bit of a passion project between the two of us as we started having fun
with the simulation.

The reason for this was due to our decision to use Unity, a rather unorthodox choice for the class based on
simulations. 

For a more detailed breakdown of this project, you may check the "Simulation Study.pdf" file included in the zip.
Alternatively, it has been uploaded as a standalone pdf for viewing.
